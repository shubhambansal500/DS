Time Complexities 

We can have three cases to analyze an algorithm: 
1) The Worst Case 
2) Average Case 
3) Best Case

Worst case - when we want to find a number n and it is not present hence we look in the data structure for n iterations hence complexity is O(n)
Avergae case - again time compexity is O(n)
Best case - when the complexity is O(1)

Example Bubble Sort
Worst and Average Cases are O(n^2)
Best case O(n)
